## Chanllenges

 - The biggest challenge of this test was to complete it in time.  It's working days so there're not much time left for me to do the task.
 - The second challenge was understanding the flow those pages, I should ask again about it so I took me a lot of time to organize data and it's not done yet
 

## Time tracking

![time][time]

I spent like more that 10 hours to do this project. I also did it at work (after lunch and before I got off work) where I forgot to install waka time so the time tracking was not really precise
